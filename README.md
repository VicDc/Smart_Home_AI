# Smart_Home_AI
🚀 Just wrapped up a cool AI project: a Smart Home Simulator powered by NLP and Transformers! 🧠💡

This Jupyter Notebook integrates AI with simulated IoT devices (Light, Fan, Thermostat) and interprets natural language commands using 🤖 Hugging Face Transformers.

🔍 What it does:

🧠 Embeds user commands with umberto-wikipedia-uncased-v1

💡 Controls simulated smart devices (on/off, speed, temperature)

🗣️ Parses natural language into actionable tasks (e.g. “Turn on the fan”)

🏠 Acts like a basic CLI for smart home automation

✨ Highlights:

Modular Python classes for each device

Simple AI-driven parser & executor

Semantic command processing (future-proof for deeper AI integration!)

📚 Perfect for:

AI + IoT learning demos

NLP command interfaces

Prototype voice assistant backends

Would love to hear your thoughts or ideas for extending it! 🔧
